# Puppet Core

This repository contains Terraform code to deploy a Puppet master and a configurable number of Puppet agent nodes in AWS. It's designed for quick provisioning of a basic Puppet-based configuration management environment, ideal for testing, development, or bootstrapping larger automation workflows.

> If using macOS to create the cloud-init data: macOS does not have `mkpasswd`. To create SHA of the local user password `docker run -it --rm alpine mkpasswd -m sha-512`

## Features
+ Deploys a Puppet master EC2 instance with SSH access and cloud-init user setup.
+ Optionally deploys one or more Puppet agent nodes using a scalable count pattern.
+ Attaches Elastic IP to the Puppet master for static public access.
+ Secure by default: SSH and Puppet ports restricted to configurable CIDRs.
